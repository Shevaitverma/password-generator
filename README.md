# password-generator
In this project I am trying to implement useEffect, useRef and use callback method for the react. 

### useEffect
`useEffect` is a react hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.

### useRef

### useCallback
`useCallback` is a react hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

#### To run project 
`cd password-generator`
use command `npm install` or `npm i` 
</br>
use command `npm run dev` to run the applcation.
